# Bloody Marry backend - an API backend for blood donation app (name pending change)

This project aims to provide a software solution to help solve difficulties with donating blood in Bulgaria.

## The problem:
Human blood cannot be synthesized thus the only way to have blood for life saving operations is by donating. When blood is needed for a patient people have to reach out to family and friends or use facebook groups to find volunteers. If you find a person to donate they might not be aware of the requirements and restrictions that come with donating blood. 

## The solution:
Create an mobile application that provides its users with a list of requests for donating blood in their area. Also give them all the required information for donating blood
